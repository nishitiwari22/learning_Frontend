<!-- The RGB colour range varies from 0 to 255. -->
 <!-- we can see the “#” character. It is used to give the hexadecimal value of any colour. You will find various references on the Internet to generate the hexadecimal values of different colours.


 
Let us now understand the working of hex colours. Hex colour is also a kind of RGB. For example, let’s take one hex value as ‘#60DCA4’, here 60 is red of RGB, DC is green of RGB, and A4 is the blue of RGB. The same value in RGB for this colour would be something (96, 220,164). -->
