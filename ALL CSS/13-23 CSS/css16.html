   <P>User Agent Stylesheet

    By default, chrome sets some property for some elements and store some default values in it. So the browser by default styles some element according to it and that styling is particularly known as user's agent style sheet. Basically it is showing the default value of browser that previously what changes were there and what changes you have made now on your page. There is also a console section where you can write JavaScript code. Sources section contains all the source codes that you have written. The most important thing in this tutorial was elements that we have already discussed. We can directly change our styles using CSS directly. </P>
